# How Stoa Works: A Simple Guide

## What is Stoa?

Stoa is a platform where you can earn money by sharing your knowledge. Ask questions, provide great answers, and get rewarded based on how helpful your contributions are.

## For Question Creators

### Creating a Question

1. **Pick a Topic**: Choose something you want to learn about or need help with
2. **Set the Stakes**: Decide how much people pay to answer (this creates the reward pool)
3. **Choose Duration**: Set how long people have to submit answers
4. **Pick Winners**: Decide how many of the best answers will be rewarded

### What You Earn

As a question creator, you earn **10% of all submission fees**. If 20 people each pay 10 tokens to answer your question, you earn 20 tokens just for asking a good question.

### Example
- You ask: "What's the best way to invest $10,000 right now?"
- Set submission cost: 5 tokens
- 30 people submit answers = 150 tokens collected
- You earn: 15 tokens (10% of all fees)
- The rest goes to reward the best answers

## For Answer Providers

### How to Earn

1. **Find Good Questions**: Look for topics where you have expertise
2. **Pay to Play**: Submit your answer along with the required fee
3. **Share Your Knowledge**: Provide detailed, helpful answers
4. **AI Evaluation**: An AI agent reviews and ranks all answers based on quality
5. **Claim Rewards**: If you're in the top answers, claim your reward

### How Much You Earn

Your reward depends on how good your answer is compared to others:
- **Best answer**: Gets the biggest share of the reward pool
- **Second best**: Gets the second biggest share
- **And so on**: Up to the maximum number of winners set by the question creator

### Reward Calculation
- 80% of all submission fees become the reward pool
- Your share = (Your score ÷ Total scores) × Reward pool

### Example
- Question has 100 tokens in the reward pool
- Your answer ranks #1 out of 3 winners with scores: You=3, Second=2, Third=1
- Total scores = 6
- Your reward = (3 ÷ 6) × 100 = 50 tokens

## The Money Flow

When someone submits an answer for 10 tokens:
- **1 token** → Platform fees (keeps Stoa running)
- **1 token** → Question creator (rewards good questions)
- **8 tokens** → Reward pool (pays answer providers)

## AI-Powered Evaluation

After the submission deadline, an AI agent automatically:
- Reviews all submitted answers
- Evaluates them for accuracy, completeness, and helpfulness
- Ranks them from best to worst
- Assigns scores that determine token distribution

The AI evaluation is:
- **Objective**: No human bias or favoritism
- **Fast**: Results typically available within hours
- **Consistent**: Same standards applied to all answers
- **Transparent**: Scores are public on the blockchain

## Key Benefits

### For Everyone
- **Fair AI Judging**: Objective evaluation without human bias
- **Quality Content**: Submission fees prevent spam
- **Transparent**: All payments and AI scores are public on the blockchain

### Safety Features
- **Emergency Refunds**: If AI evaluation takes too long (7+ days), you can get your money back
- **Secure Payments**: All transactions handled by smart contracts
- **Automated Process**: No waiting for human evaluators

## Getting Started

1. **Get Tokens**: You'll need the specific token each question uses
2. **Find Questions**: Browse available questions in your areas of expertise
3. **Submit Answers**: Pay the fee and share your knowledge
4. **Wait for AI Results**: AI evaluation happens automatically after the submission deadline
5. **Claim Rewards**: Collect your earnings if the AI ranked your answer in the top winners
